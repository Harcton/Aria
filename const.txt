First things to try when shit goes down with the pi:
	1. Rebuild
	2. Turn on verbose build output: Tools>Options>Build&Run>...output verbosity
	
ld returned 1 exit status -> Check Linker/library dependencies.
	/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -l... check the following:
		Generated .a file is named with the lib- prefix
		NO l- or lib- prefix in the linker input!
	
Cannot insert breakpoint -1 -> Rebuild(?)

Unable to start debugging, remote connection closed ->
	1. Rebuild the solution?
	2. Once this happens, it doesn't seem to revert by reverting whatever you were doing at the time...
	3. Removing library dependency "removes the problem" for a while.

Doesn't build when changes are being made? Check the currently active configuration...

A load of weird build errors?
	Try searching output for "ld returned 1 exit status"
